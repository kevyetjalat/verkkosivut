      <p> At a railroad station in Hamadan, Iran, on 8 April 1942, Polish soldiers encountered a young Iranian boy who had found a bear cub whose mother had been shot by hunters. One of the civilian refugees in their midst, eighteen-year-old Irena Bokiewicz, the great-niece of General Bolesław, was very taken with the cub.
        She prompted Lieutenant Anatol Tarnowiecki to buy the young bear. <br> <br>
      The bear spent the next three months in a Polish refugee camp established near Tehran, principally under Irena's care. </p>

      <p>Wojtek initially had problems swallowing and was fed condensed milk from an old vodka bottle. <br><br>He was subsequently given fruit, marmalade, honey, and syrup, and was often rewarded with beer, which became his favourite drink. </p>

      <p>Wojtek had his own caregiver, assigned to look after him. The cub grew up while on campaign, and by the time of the Battle of Monte Cassino he weighed 90 kilograms. <br><br>
        He later also enjoyed smoking (or eating) cigarettes, as well as drinking coffee in the mornings. He also would sleep with the other soldiers if they were ever cold in the night.</p>
